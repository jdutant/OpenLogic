\olsection{Semantics in system $\Log{K}$}

\emph{Note on the semantics.} A modal !!{structure} includes a
!!{valuation} $V$ that assigns $\True$ or $\False$ to each
!!{propositional variable} at each world. There are two equivalent ways
of specifying $V$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We say that $V$ assigns to each !!{propositional
    variable}--world pair a truth value: $V(\Obj{\pvar{A}},w)=\True$.
    \item We say that $V$ assigns to each !!{propositional variable}
    the set of worlds at which it is true:
    $V(\Obj{\pvar{A}})=\{w,v\}$. $\Obj{\pvar{A}}$ is $\True$ at $u$ if
    $u\in V(\Obj{\pvar{A}})$, otherwise it is $\False$ at that world.
\end{enumerate}
You may use either way. Exercises below use sometimes the former, 
sometimes the latter.

\begin{prob}[Truth in a pointed model]
    Consider the model $\mModel{M}=\tuple{W,@,R,V}$ with
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $W=\{@,v,w\}$
        \item $R=\{\tuple{@,v},\tuple{@,w},\tuple{v,@},\tuple{w,v},\tuple{w,w}\}$
        \item
        $V(\Obj{\pvar{A}},@)=V(\Obj{\pvar{B}},v)=V(\Obj{\pvar{C}},w)=\True$,
        all else $\False$.
    \end{itemize}
    Say whether the following formulas are true in the !!{structure}
    (that is, true at $@$ in the !!{structure}). No need to justify
    your answers.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\Diamond \Obj{\pvar{A}}$
        \item $\Box(\Obj{\pvar{C}}\lif\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{B}})$
        \item $\Box(\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{C}\lor\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{A}}})$
        \item $\Box\Box\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{B}}$
    \end{enumerate} 
    
    \begin{ans}

      \end{center}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $\Diamond \Obj{\pvar{A}}$ False. The only worlds
            accessible to $@$ are $v,w$ and $\Obj{\pvar{A}}$ isn't
            true at either.

            \item $\Box(\Obj{\pvar{C}}\lif\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{B}})$.
            True. To see this, we need to check that
            $\Obj{\pvar{C}}\lif\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{B}}$ is true at all
            the worlds accessible to $@$, namely $v,w$. At $v$,
            $\Obj{\pvar{C}}$ is false, so
            $\Obj{\pvar{C}}\lif\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{B}}$ is true. At
            $w$, $w$ has acess to $v$ where $\Obj{\pvar{B}}$ is true,
            so $\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{B}}$ is true and hence
            $\Obj{\pvar{C}}\lif\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{B}}$ is true. Since 
            it is true at all worlds accessible from $@$, 
            $\Box(\Obj{\pvar{C}}\lif\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{B}})$ is true 
            at $@$.

            \item
            $\Box(\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{C}\lor\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{A}}})$.
            True. $\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{C}} \lor\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{A}}$
            is true at $v$ because $\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{A}}$ is true at
            $v$, because $v$ has access to $@$ and $\Obj{\pvar{A}}$ is
            true at $@$. ($\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{C}}$ is false at $v$ but
            $\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{A}}$ true at $v$ is enough to make
            $\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{C}} \lor\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{A}}$ is
            true at $v$.) $\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{C}}
            \lor\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{A}}$ is also true at $w$ because
            $\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{C}}$ is true at $w$, because $w$ has
            access to itself and $\Obj{\pvar{R}}$ is true at $w$.
            Therefore, $\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{A}}
            \lor\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{C}}$ is true at any world $@$ has
            access to: $w,v$. So $\Box(\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{C}}
            \lor\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{A}})$ is true at $@$.

            \item $\Box\Box\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{B}}$. False. Strategy:
            for this to be true at $@$, it must be that any worlds
            accessible in two steps from $@$ is a world where
            $\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{B}}$ is true, i.e., a world that has
            acess to a world where $\Obj{\pvar{B}}$ is true. Hence a
            good start is to look for worlds where
            $\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{B}}$ is false, and check whether one
            of them is accessible in two steps from $@$. Solution: $v$
            only has access to $@$ and  $\Obj{\pvar{B}}$ isn't true at
            $@$, hence $\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{B}}$ is false at $v$. Since
            $w$ has access to $v$ and $\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{B}}$ is
            false at $v$, $\Box\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{B}}$ is false at
            $w$. Since $@$ has access to $w$ and
            $\Box\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{B}}$ is false at $w$,
            $\Box\Box\Diamond\Obj{\pvar{B}}$ is false at $@$.
        \end{enumerate} 
        
    \end{ans}
    
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}[Truth at a world]
    Consider the model $\mModel{M}$ with worlds $W = \{u,v,w\}$, accessibility
    relation $R=\{\tuple{u,v},\tuple{v,u},\tuple{v,v},\tuple{v,w},\tuple{w,v},\tuple{w,w}\}$ 
    and $V$ such that $V(\Obj{\pvar{A}}) = \{ u \}$, $V(\Obj{\pvar{B}}) = \{ v \}$, $V(\Obj{\pvar{C}}) = \{ w \}$.
    
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Draw a graph of the model. 
    \item Say whether in $\mModel{M}$ these !!{formula}s are true or false 
        at the world indicated:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $\Diamond \Obj{\pvar{A}}$ at world $u$
            \item $\Box \Obj{\pvar{A}}$ at world $u$

        \begin{enumerate}
        \item False, $\mSat/{M}{\Diamond \Obj{\pvar{A}}}[u]$\\
        \emph{Comment. }The only world that $u$ ``sees'' is $v$,
        where $\Obj{\pvar{A}}$ is false. So there is no world that $u$ sees where
        $\Obj{\pvar{A}}$ is true.
        \item False, $\mSat/{M}{\Box \Obj{\pvar{A}}}[u]$\\
        \emph{Comment}. Not all the worlds $u$ ``sees'' are $\Obj{\pvar{A}}$ worlds,
        since it sees $v$ where $\Obj{\pvar{A}}$  is false.
        \item True, $\mSat{M}{\Box \Obj{\pvar{B}}}[u]$\\
        \emph{Comment}. $u$ only ``sees'' one world, $v$, and in that world
        $\Obj{\pvar{B}}$ is true, so $\Box \Obj{\pvar{B}}$ is true at $u$. Note that the fact
        that $\Obj{\pvar{B}}$ is false at $u$ itself doesn't matter, because $u$
        doesn't ``see'' itself. 
        \item True,  $\mSat{M}{\Diamond\lnot(\Obj{\pvar{C}}\lif \Obj{\pvar{B}})}[w]$\\
        \emph{Comment}. $w$ sees two worlds, $v$ and $w$. Is
        one of them one in which $\lnot(\Obj{\pvar{C}}\lif \Obj{\pvar{B}})$ is true? 
        $\lnot(\Obj{\pvar{C}}\lif \Obj{\pvar{B}})$ is true just if $\Obj{\pvar{C}}\lif \Obj{\pvar{B}}$
        is false, that is, just if $\Obj{\pvar{C}}$ is true and $\Obj{\pvar{B}}$ is
        false. $w$ is a world where that is so. So $w$ sees a world,
        namely itself, where $\lnot(\Obj{\pvar{C}}\lif \Obj{\pvar{B}})$ is true. 
        \item False, 	$\mSat/{M}{\Box(\lnot \Obj{\pvar{B}}\lif \Obj{\pvar{C}})}[v]$\\
        \emph{Comment}. $\lnot \Obj{\pvar{B}}\lif \Obj{\pvar{C}}$ is true if $\lnot\Obj{\pvar{B}}$ 
        is false or $\Obj{\pvar{C}}$ is true, that is, if one of $\Obj{\pvar{B}}, \Obj{\pvar{C}}$ 
        is true. That happens at two worlds that $v$ sees, namely $v$
        and $w$, but not at a third world that $v$ sees, namely $u$. 
        \item False, $\mSat/{M}{\Diamond(\Obj{\pvar{B}}\land\Box \Obj{\pvar{A}})}[w]$\\
        \emph{Comment. }$w$ sees two worlds, $v$ and itself. Is
        any of these one where $\Obj{\pvar{B}}\land\Box \Obj{\pvar{A}}$ is true? Not $w$, since
        $\Obj{\pvar{B}}$ is false in $w$. At $v$,
        $\Obj{\pvar{B}}$ is true; but is $\Box \Obj{\pvar{A}}$ true? No, because $v$ sees some
        worlds where $\Obj{\pvar{A}}$ is false ($v$ and $w$). So $\Obj{\pvar{B}}\land\Box \Obj{\pvar{A}}$
        is not true in $v$ either. Since $w$ doesn't see a world
        where it is true, $\Diamond(\Obj{\pvar{B}}\land\Box \Obj{\pvar{A}})$ is false
        at $w$.
        \item True, $\mSat{M}{\Diamond\Box \Obj{\pvar{B}}}[v]$\\
        \emph{Comment}. $v$ sees $u$. $u$ is a world where
        $\Box \Obj{\pvar{B}}$ is true (see qu. 3 above). So $\Diamond\Box Q$ is true
        at $v$.
        \item True, $\mSat{M}{\Box(\Box \Obj{\pvar{B}}\lif\Diamond \Obj{\pvar{C}})}[u]$\\
        \emph{Comment}. This is true iff all the worlds $u$ sees are
        ones where $\Box \Obj{\pvar{B}}\lif\Diamond \Obj{\pvar{C}}$ is true. Since $u$
        only sees $v$, we need only check whether $\Box \Obj{\pvar{B}}\lif\Diamond \Obj{\pvar{C}}$
        is true at $v$. $\Box \Obj{\pvar{B}}$ is false at $v$ (since it sees
        worlds where $\Obj{\pvar{B}}$ is false, namely $u$ and $w$), so $\Box \Obj{\pvar{B}}\lif\Diamond \Obj{\pvar{C}}$
        is true at $v$. Alternatively, you can note that $\Diamond \Obj{\pvar{C}}$ is true at $v$
        (since it sees a world where $\Obj{\pvar{C}}$ is true, namely $w$), so 
        we again get that  $\Box \Obj{\pvar{B}}\lif\Diamond \Obj{\pvar{C}}$
        is true at $v$. Since that $\Box \Obj{\pvar{B}}\lif\Diamond \Obj{\pvar{C}}$ true at all
        the worlds $u$ sees (namely $v$), $\Box(\Box \Obj{\pvar{B}}\lif\Diamond \Obj{\pvar{C}})$
        is true at $u$. \\
        \emph{Note} that $\Box \Obj{\pvar{B}}\lif\Diamond \Obj{\pvar{C}})$ is false at $u$ itself.
        But since $u$ doesn't see itself, that doesn't prevent $\Box(\Box \Obj{\pvar{B}}\lif\Diamond \Obj{\pvar{C}})$
        to be true at $u$.
        \item False, $\mSat/{M}{\Box\Diamond(\lnot \Obj{\pvar{C}}\lif\lnot \Obj{\pvar{B}})}[v]$\\
        \emph{Comment}. $v$ sees three worlds, $u$, $v$, $w$,
        so we must check whether $\Diamond(\lnot \Obj{\pvar{C}}\lif\lnot \Obj{\pvar{B}})$
        is true in each of them. Is it true at $u$? $u$ only sees $v$;
        $v$ is a world where $\lnot \Obj{\pvar{C}}\lif\lnot \Obj{\pvar{B}}$ is false 
        ($\lnot \Obj{\pvar{C}}$ is true and $\lnot \Obj{\pvar{B}}$ false), so 
        $\Diamond(\lnot \Obj{\pvar{C}}\lif\lnot \Obj{\pvar{B}})$ is false at $u$. 
        No need to check further: some world $v$ sees is one 
        where $\Diamond(\lnot \Obj{\pvar{C}}\lif\lnot \Obj{\pvar{B}})$ fails, so 
        $\Box\Diamond(\lnot \Obj{\pvar{C}}\lif\lnot \Obj{\pvar{B}})$ is false at $v$. 
        \item False, $\mSat/{M}{\Diamond\Diamond\Box \Obj{\pvar{C}}}[u]$\\
        \emph{Comment}. This is true iff $u$ sees some world that sees
        some world where $\Box \Obj{\pvar{C}}$ is true. But it's easy to check 
        that $\Box \Obj{\pvar{C}}$ is \emph{false} at all our worlds (each of our worlds 
        sees $v$, and $\Obj{\pvar{C}}$ is false at $v$). So there is simply no world where
        $\Box \Obj{\pvar{C}}$ is true, so no world can see a world that sees
        a world where $\Box \Obj{\pvar{C}}$ is true. So that's false at $u$ (or anywhere
        else for that matter).
        \end{enumerate}
    
    \end{ans}
    
    \end{prob}
    
    \begin{prob}
    For each of the following !!{formula}s, devise a model with a world $w$
    such that the formula is \emph{false} at $w$. 
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\Diamond \Obj{\pvar{A}}\lif\Box \Obj{\pvar{A}}$
        \item $\Diamond \Obj{\pvar{A}}\land\Diamond \Obj{\pvar{B}}\lif\Diamond(\Obj{\pvar{A}}\land \Obj{\pvar{B}})$

        \item $\Diamond \Obj{\pvar{A}}\lif\Box\Diamond \Obj{\pvar{A}}$ (schema $\Ax{5}$)
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \emph{Example answer: (1)}. Take $\mModel{M}$ with $W=\{w,v\}$, 
    $R=\{\tuple{w,w},\tuple{w,v}\}$, $V(\Obj{\pvar{A}})=\{w\}$. 
    
    \emph{Note} Labelled items ($\Ax{D}$, $\Ax{T}$, 
    $\Ax{B}$, $\Ax{4}$, $\Ax{5}$) are instances of these 
    well-known schemas of modal logic. The labels are for
    your future reference, ignore them when answering this exercise.
    
    \begin{ans}
        Some answers. In each case, you can check that the
        !!{formula} is false at world $w$. Of course other models 
        could have been used too. 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $\mModel{M}$ with $W=\{w,v\}$, $R=\{\tuple{w,w},\tuple{w,v}\}$, 
                $V(\Obj{\pvar{A}})=\{w\}$. 
            \item $\mModel{M}$ with $W=\{w,v\}$, $R=\{\tuple{w,w}\tuple{w,v}\}$,
                $V(\Obj{\pvar{A}})=\{w\}$, $V(\Obj{\pvar{B}})=\{v\}$. 
            \item $W=\{u\},$ $R=\varnothing$ (the empty set: nothing is related to
            nothing), $V(\Obj{\pvar{A}})=\varnothing$. \emph{Note:} in that question, 
            you need $w$ to \emph{not} have access to any worlds. And that's 
            all you need: any model where $w$ doesn't have access to any world 
            will make this !!{formula} false at $w$. 
            \item Same model as in the previous question, you need $w$ to not have access
            to any world. And that's all you need. So you may use the same model.
            \item $\mModel{M}$ with $W=\{w,v\}$, $R=\{\tuple{w,v}\}$, 
                $V(\Obj{\pvar{A}})=\{v\}$. Note that $\Box \Obj{\pvar{A}}$ is true at $w$
                because the only world $w$ has access to is $v$, where $\Obj{\pvar{A}}$ 
                is true. 
            \item Same model as in the previous question. You need $\Diamond \Obj{\pvar{A}}$
            and $\Box \Obj{\pvar{A}}$ to be true at $w$ but $\Obj{\pvar{A}}$ to be false at $w$. 
            So a model where $w$ doesn't have access to itself, but only sees
            worlds where $\Obj{\pvar{A}}$ is true. 
            \item $\mModel{M}$ with $W=\{w,v\}$, $R=\{\tuple{w,w},\tuple{w,v}
                \tuple{v,v}\}$, 
                $V(\Obj{\pvar{A}})=\{w\}$. Note that $\Diamond \Obj{\pvar{A}}$ is false at $v$. 
                You could also use that model with $R=\{\tuple{w,v}\}$ instead.
                More generally, any model with non-symmetric $R$ will do.
            \item $\mModel{M}$ with $W=\{w,v,u\}$, $R=\{\tuple{w,w},
                \tuple{w,v},\tuple{v,u}\}$, 
                $V(\Obj{\pvar{A}})=\{w,v\}$. More generally, you need a model where 
                $R$ is not transitive.
            \item $\mModel{M}$ with $W=\{w,v,u\}$, $R=\{\tuple{w,v},\tuple{v,u}\}$, 
                $V(\Obj{\pvar{A}})=\{u\}$. Note that $\Box\Obj{\pvar{A}}$ is true at $v$.
            \item You could use models (7) or (8) above. Or: $\mModel{M}$ with 
                $W=\{w,v,u\}$, $R=\{\tuple{w,v},\tuple{w,u}\}$, 
                $V(\Obj{\pvar{A}})=\{v\}$. In general, you need a model that is 
                "non-Euclidean", with $Rwx$ and $Rwy$ but not $Rxy$ for some
                worlds $x$, $y$.
