\olsection{Rules for stronger systems}

We provide rules for stronger systems. In these systems the rules for 
\Log{K} are still allowed, but we supplement them with additional rules.

\iftag{prvDiamond}{Except for \Ax{D}, rules come in two forms, e.g.
$\Box$\Ax{T} and $\Diamond$\Ax{T}. In each case only one is needed: 
the other can be derived (using Duality). However, we allow both 
forms to simplify our proofs.}{}

\subsection{Rules for \Log{D}, \Log{T}}

In \Log{D}, we relax the constraint that \Intro{\Diamond}\Ax{K} must
have a $\Diamond!A$ premise: this results in \Intro{\Diamond}\Ax{D}
below.

\begin{defish}

    \AxiomC{\emph{no undischarged assumption}}\DeduceC{$!C$}
    \RightLabel{\Intro{\Diamond}\Ax{D}}
    \UnaryInfC{$\Diamond!C$}
    \DisplayProof
\hfill
    \AxiomC{}\DeduceC{$\Box!A$}
    \RightLabel{\Ax{D}}
    \UnaryInfC{$\Diamond!A$}
    \DisplayProof
    \bigskip


    \AxiomC{}\DeduceC{$\Box!A$}
    \RightLabel{$\Box$\Ax{T}}
    \UnaryInfC{$!A$}
    \DisplayProof
\hfill
   \AxiomC{}\DeduceC{$!A$}
    \RightLabel{$\Diamond$\Ax{T}}
    \UnaryInfC{$\Diamond!A$}
    \DisplayProof

\end{defish}

\begin{itemize}
    \item System \Log{D} is \Log{K} plus the \Ax{D} rule.
    \item System \Log{T} is \Log{K} plus the \Ax{T} rule. We also
    allow the \Ax{D} rules. 
\end{itemize}

The \Ax{D} rules are sound for \emph{serial} frames and \Ax{T} is sound
for \emph{reflexive} frames. 

We allow the \Ax{D} rules in \Log{T} and any system that contains the
\Ax{T} rules because the \Ax{D} rules are !!{derivable} from the
\Ax{T} rules. For $\Diamond$\Ax{D}:

\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{}\DeduceC{$\Box!A$}
\RightLabel{$\Box$\Ax{T}}
\UnaryInfC{$!A$}
\RightLabel{$\Diamond$\Ax{T}}
\UnaryInfC{$\Diamond!A$}
\end{prooftree}

\begin{prob}
    Show $\Proves[\Log{D}] \Box!A\lif\lnot\Box\lnot!A$.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
    Show $\Proves[\Log{D}] \Diamond!A\lor\Diamond\lnot!A$.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
    Show that the \Intro{\Diamond}\Ax{D} rule is !!{derivable} from
    the \Log{K} plus \Ax{T} rules.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
    Show $\Proves[\Log{T}] \Box(\Box!A\lif!A)$.
\end{prob}

\subsection{Rules for \Log{S4}, \Log{B}, \Log{S5}}

\begin{defish}
    \AxiomC{}\DeduceC{$\Box!A$}
    \RightLabel{$\Box$\Ax{4}}
    \UnaryInfC{$\Box\Box!A$}
    \DisplayProof
\hfill
    \AxiomC{}\DeduceC{$\Diamond\Diamond!A$}
    \RightLabel{$\Diamond$\Ax{4}}
    \UnaryInfC{$\Diamond!A$}
    \DisplayProof

\bigskip
    \AxiomC{}\DeduceC{$!A$}
    \RightLabel{$\Box$\Ax{B}}
    \UnaryInfC{$\Box\Diamond!A$}
    \DisplayProof
\hfill
    \AxiomC{}\DeduceC{$\Diamond\Box!A$}
    \RightLabel{$\Diamond$\Ax{B}}
    \UnaryInfC{$!A$}
    \DisplayProof

\bigskip
    \AxiomC{}\DeduceC{$\Diamond!A$}
    \RightLabel{$\Box$\Ax{5}}
    \UnaryInfC{$\Box\Diamond!A$}
    \DisplayProof
\hfill
    \AxiomC{}\DeduceC{$\Diamond\Box!A$}
    \RightLabel{$\Diamond$\Ax{5}}
    \UnaryInfC{$\Box!A$}
    \DisplayProof

\end{defish}

The \Ax{4} rules are sound for \emph{transitive} frames; the \Ax{B}
rules are sound for \emph{symmetric} frames and the \Ax{5} rules are
sound for \emph{euclidean} frames. 

Individually, rules \Ax{T}, \Ax{4}, \Ax{B} and \Ax{5} are independent
of each other. However, the following relations hold:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Given \Ax{B} and \Ax{D}, we can derive \Ax{T}.
    \item Given \Ax{T}, \Ax{4}, and \Ax{B}, we can derive \Ax{5}.
    \item Given \Ax{T} and \Ax{5}, we can derive \Ax{4} and \Ax{5}.
\end{itemize}
From \Ax{5} alone we cannot derive \Ax{4} or \Ax{B}. From \Ax{T} and \Ax{4}
alone we cannot derive \Ax{B} nor \Ax{5}. From \Ax{T} and \Ax{B} we cannot
derive \Ax{4} nor \Ax{5}. 

Because of the facts above, there are only three distinct systems 
extending \Log{T} with one or more of \Ax{4}, \Ax{B} and \Ax{5}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \Log{B} that extends \Log{T} with \Ax{B}. It has neither \Ax{4} nor \Ax{5}.
\item \Log{S4} that extends \Log{T} with \Ax{4}. It has neither \Ax{B} nor \Ax{5}.
\item \Log{S5} that extends \Log{T} with \Ax{5}. It also has both of \Ax{B} and \Ax{4}.
\end{itemize}
Since all these systems extend \Log{T}, they all have the \Log{K},
\Ax{T} and \Ax{D} rules too.

More generally, we can describe systems by listing their rules. 
\Log{KD45} is the system given by the \Ax{K}, \Ax{D}, \Ax{4} and \Ax{5}
rules. \Log{S4} can be called \Log{KT4} or \Log{KDT4}; \Log{S5} can 
be called \Log{KT5}, \Log{KT45}, \Log{KDTB45}, and many other names.

The standard systems, their conditions on accessibility relation and
their rules are in \olref{natdedsrules}.
