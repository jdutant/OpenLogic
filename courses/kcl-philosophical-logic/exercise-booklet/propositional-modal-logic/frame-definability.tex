\begin{prob}[Correspondence facts for types of models]

For each of the schemas below, show that it holds in all models of the given type.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item (Distribution) $\Box(!A \lif !B)\lif(\Box !A \lif \Box !B)$ in all models.
	\item ($\Ax D$) $\Box !A \lif \Diamond !A$ in serial models.
	\item Pick one of the following, in reflexive models:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item ($\Ax T$) $\Box !A \lif !A$
		\item ($\Ax{T\Diamond}$) $!A \lif \Diamond !A$
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Pick one of the following, in symmetric models:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item ($\Ax{B}$)  $!A \lif \Box \Diamond !A$
		\item ($\Ax{B\Diamond}$) $\Diamond \Box !A \lif !A$
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Pick one of the following, in transitive models:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item ($\Ax 4$)  $\Box !A \lif \Box \Box !A$
		\item ($\Ax{4\Diamond}$) $\Diamond\Diamond !A \lif \Diamond !A$
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Pick one of the following, in euclidean models:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item ($\Ax 5$) $\Diamond !A \lif \Box \Diamond !A$
		\item ($\Ax{5\Diamond}$) $\Diamond\Box !A \lif \Box !A$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Example answer: (2)(a)}. Let $\mModel{M}$ be a reflexive 
model, $w$ a world in $\mModel{M}$ and $!A$ a sentence. Suppose 
$\mSat{M}{\Box !A}[w]$. Since $\mModel{M}$ is reflexive, $Rww$ so
$\mSat{M}{!A}[w]$. Hence $\mSat{M}{\Box !A \lif !A}[w]$. Since $w$
was arbitrary, that holds for any world: $\mSat{M}{\Box !A \lif !A}$. 

\emph{Reminder}. Recall that: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item An accessibility relation $R$ is \emph{serial} iff every world `sees' 
	(has access to) some world: $\lforall[w][\lexists[v][Rwv]]$.
	\item $R$ is \emph{reflexive} iff every world sees itself: $\lforall[w][Rww]$.
	\item $R$ is \emph{symmetric} iff whenever a world sees another world, the latter 
	sees the former: $\lforall[w][\lforall[v][(Rwv \lif Rwv)]]$.
	\item $R$ is \emph{transitive} iff whenever a world $w$ sees a world $v$ and $v$ a world $u$, $w$ sees $u$ too: $\lforall[w][\lforall[v][\lforall[u][(Rwv \land Rvu) \lif Rwu]]]$.
	\item $R$ is \emph{euclidean} iff whenever a world $w$ sees a world $v$ and a world $u$, $v$ and $u$ see each other: $\lforall[w][\lforall[v][\lforall[u][(Rwv \land Rwv) \lif Rvu]]]$.
	\item $R$ is \emph{an equivalence relation} or \emph{partitional} iff $R$ is reflexive,
	symmetric and transitive. (It's also euclidean, because a relation that is both symmetric and transitive is euclidean.)
\end{itemize}

\end{prob}

\begin{prob}[Relation between two systems]

\Log{KTB} is the class of reflexive and symmetric models; \Log{KT5} 
the class of reflexive and euclidean models. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Show that a relation can be euclidean 
	without being symmetric, or symmetric without being euclidean. 
	\item Show that if a relation is \emph{reflexive and} euclidean then
	it is symmetric. 
	\item Show that the converse is not true: a relation may be reflexive
	and symmetric without being euclidean.
	\item Given (2)-(3), what is the relation between the classes of 
	models \Log{KTB} and \Log{KT5}?
	\item Say which of the following (if any) is true: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item If $\Gamma \Entails[KTB] !A$ then $\Gamma \Entails[KT5] !A$ 
		\item If $\Gamma \Entails[KT5] !A$ then $\Gamma \Entails[KTB] !A$ 
	\end{enumerate}	
\end{enumerate}	

\emph{Tips}. For (1) and (3) you only need examples to illustrates both possibilities. 
	Three-worlds (or three-items) models suffice.

\end{prob}

\begin{prob}[From models to frames]
Answer the following.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let $\mModel{M}$ be a model with $W=\{w,v\}$,
	$R=\{\tuple{w,v}\}$, and $V$ that assigns the same
	value to every !!{propositional variable} at $w$ 
	and $v$, i.e. $V(\Obj{\pvar{A}}_i) = \{w,v\}$ or $V(\Obj{\pvar{A}}_i) = \varnothing$ 
	for all $i$.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Show that $\mSat{M}{\Box !A \lif !A}$.
		\item Let $\mModel{M'}$ be with $W$ and $R$ as before
		but $V(\Obj{\pvar{A}})=\{v\}$. Show that 
		$\mSat/{M}{\Box \Obj{\pvar{A}} \lif \Obj{\pvar{A}}}[w]$.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Find a \emph{non-transitive} model in 
	which schema $\Ax{4}$ is true. 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item State your proposed model. 
		\item Show that the schema holds in the
		in the model.
		\item Show that by changing its valuation you 
		can make the schema fail. (That is, there is a model with
		the same worlds and accessibility relation but a different
		valuation in which the schema fails.)
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\end{prob}

\begin{prob}[Correspondence facts for frames]
Establish the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\Ax{D}$ is only valid on serial frames. 
	\item $\Ax{T}$ is only valid on reflexive frames.
	\item $\Ax{B}$ is only valid on symmetric frames.
	\item $\Ax{4}$ is only valid on transitive frames. 
	\item $\Ax{5}$ is only valid on euclidean frames.
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Tip}. Establish these by contraposition: suppose a
frame $\mModel{F}$ isn't serial, and show that you can
build a model based on that frame in which $\Box \Obj{\pvar{A}} 
\lif \Diamond \Obj{\pvar{A}}$ is false at some world.

\emph{Example answer for (2)}. Suppose $\mModel{F}=\tuple{W,R}$ 
is not a reflexive frame, i.e. there is a world $w$ in $W$ 
that doesn't have access to itself ($Rww$ fails). Let 
$\mModel{M}$ be any model based on $\mModel{F}$ with a valuation
$V$ such that: $V(\Obj{\pvar{A}}) = \{v\in W: v \not= w\}$, 
that is, $\Obj{\pvar{A}}$ is true at any world other than $w$. Since
$w$ only has access to worlds other than itself ($Rwv$ only 
if $v \not= w$), and since $\Obj{\pvar{A}}$ is true at all those worlds 
($v\in V(\Obj{\pvar{A}})$ if $v \not= w$), we have $\Box \Obj{\pvar{A}}$ true
at $w$: $\mSat{M}{\Box \Obj{\pvar{A}}}[w]$. But since $w \notin V(\Obj{\pvar{A}})$
we have $\mSat/{M}{\Obj{\pvar{A}}}[w]$ and hence
 $\mSat/{M}{\Box \Obj{\pvar{A}} \lif \Obj{\pvar{A}}}[w]$. So $\mSat/{F}{\Box !A \lif !A}$.

\end{prob}
