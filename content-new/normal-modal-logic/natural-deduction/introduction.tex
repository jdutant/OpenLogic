\olsection{Introduction}

Natural deduction for propositional logic can be extended by
additional rules that deal
with~\iftag{prvBox}{$\Box$\iftag{prvDiamond}{ and~}{}}{}%
\iftag{prvDiamond}{$\Diamond$}{}. We give rules for~$\Log{K}$ and
additional rules for stronger systems.

All out systems extend propositional logic and therefore include
all its rules.
