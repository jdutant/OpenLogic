\begin{prob}
    (weak) Secondary reflexive. If Rwv, then Rvv.
    explain that a model can be secondary reflexive without being serial.
    show that every model that is euclidean is secondary reflexive, but not the other way round.
    show that every model that is transitive and symmetric is secondary reflexive.
    can you give a characteristic schema for secondary reflexive frames?
\end{prob}
